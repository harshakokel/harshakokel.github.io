      <description>Daniel Zügner and Stephan Günnemann, ICLR 2019 Paper highlights the weakness of Graph Neural Networks. Since the iid assumption does not hold in the graph data, any perturbation at a single node might have major impacts. This weakness can be leveraged by adversaries to attack GNN. The paper is set in a transductive learning setting where a graph is given along with label to some of the nodes and the task is to predict labels of the remaining nodes.</description>
