      <description>This paper focuses on $q$-shot $K$-way classification problem &amp;ndash; where we have $K$ class labels and for each class label we have $q$ example images, so totally we have $s=qK$ training images. Authors propose to leverage the progress in Graph Convolutional Networks by formulating this problem as a node classification problem in graph $(G=(V,E))$, where nodes are images and an edge between two nodes indicate those two images are similar and may have same labels.</description>
