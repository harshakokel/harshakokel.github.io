      <description>Craig Knoblock, AIJ 1994  This paper highlights a heuristic property called ordered monotonicity propery of hierarchical domains and provides a way to learn the hierarchy using the sufficient condition for that property.
A problem space is defined as $\Sigma = \langle L, S, O \rangle$, consisting of $L$ is set of first-order literals, $S$ is the set of finite states (described using literals), and $O$ is the set of operators in the domain.</description>

      <description>Standard RL planning suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the action space is too large and/or state space is infeasible to enumerate. Humans simplify the problem of planning in such complex conditions by abstracting away details which are not relevant at a given time and decomposing actions into hierarchies. Several researchers have proposed to model the temporal-abstraction in RL by composing some form of hierarchy over actions space (Dietterich 1998, Sutton et al 1998, Parr and Russell 1998).</description>
